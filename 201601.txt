iSCSI Introduction

iSCSI is one of the hottest topics in Storage because it allows you to create centralized SANs using TCP networks rather than Fibre Channel (FC) networks. Get a handle on the main iSCSI concepts and terminology

SANs (Storage Area Networks) are popular as a storage system for many reasons. Most commonly they are popular because the storage is centralized allowing easier management, easier maintenance, very good performance, and it has a good price/performance ratio. Typical SANs are constructed using Fibre Channel (FC) networks and FC hard drives, although SATA, SAS, and SSD drives are used in SANs today.

FC storage has very good performance from the storage hardware to the client using FC networks networks at 2Gb/s, 4Gb/s, and now 8 Gb/s speeds. But FC based SANs require an FC card in each client as well as an FC network (switches) in addition to the normal TCP networks that clients have, adding cost and complexity to servers.

FC based SANs are popular because of very good performance and all of the benefits of centralized storage. But at the same time, they can be rather expensive and complex. But, there is the option of using iSCSI for SANs keeping the benefits of SANs and reducing the complexity because only a TCP network is needed.

Case Study:

Title: A data protection solution based on Openstack Cinder.

Abstract:
How to prectect data inside a VM which for system partition and extended partition? This is the biggest concern
which boosted from our customer. The customer used openstack to build their provate cloud. And there are more than
 100 applications running on the cloud. And plenty of data are generated daily. Customer need a unified solution
from openstack to help them to back up the VM and the data. Openstack will do this in glance which is limited by 
the data transaction speed in the SAN. We introduced a solution based on Cinder which help
openstack to backup VM's snapshot and volume's snapshot in cinder. Once disaster hapened, A new VM with the latest 
data will be booted. Meanwhile, the extended partition also can be attach from cinder volue. In This way, we imporve
the performance with double times than the tradtional.

Title: 
Solution to claim/release compute resoure from Openstack cloud for disaster recovery.

Abastract:

In 2015, we have an important client in China. They are building a private cloud together with their disaster recovery
data center. This is difference from the DRaaS. They want the cloud to manage all the physical compute resource, include
the reserved resource for their disaster recovery. However, they hope once the disaster occured. All the resoure which 
planned for DR will be reclaimed from the cloud resource. We provide the solution to  meet customer's requirement. And 
help them to design a new architecture and new extended application to help openstack manage the DR resource and release
them as required.


Title: Cinder Multi-backend introduction and advance tips

Abstract: 

In customer real environment, openstack may manage different storage device as block device backend. This topic will help
customer to manage them in cinder with multi-backend configed. And even with same storage device, we can also group them 
and use them in openstack cinder. With the help of different volume-type definced, openstack will help end user manage their
storage easily. Furthermore, there are severial tips will also be introduced in this topic. For example, we can define different
volume type to define different storage vary from different vendor, and different volume type to define different quality storage,
such as high performance stroage will be used from high quality required application, and low performance storage will be used for
others. There will be a detail introdction for more tips in final ppt.

SAN Introduction

Virtually every server needs some sort of storage and the associated backup devices and management software. Originally this meant that every server had its own storage, its own backup device, its own management tools, its own security, etc. as show below in Figure 1. This configuration is commonly called Direct Attached Storage (DAS).
